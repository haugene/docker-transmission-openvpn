## Quick Start

## WARNING : this fork is only a working fork... always refer to the orginal Haugene repository

This container contains OpenVPN and Transmission with a configuration
where Transmission is running only when OpenVPN has an active tunnel.
It bundles configuration files for many popular VPN providers to make the setup easier.

```
$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -d \
              -v /your/storage/path/:/data \
              -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
              -e CREATE_TUN_DEVICE=true \
              -e OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PIA \
              -e OPENVPN_CONFIG=CA\ Toronto \
              -e OPENVPN_USERNAME=user \
              -e OPENVPN_PASSWORD=pass \
              -e WEBPROXY_ENABLED=false \
              -e LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/16 \
              --log-driver json-file \
              --log-opt max-size=10m \

## Please help out (about:maintenance)
This image was created for my own use, but sharing is caring, so it had to be open source.
It has now gotten quite popular, and that's great! But keeping it up to date, providing support, fixes
and new features takes a lot of time.

I'm therefore kindly asking you to donate if you feel like you're getting a good tool
and you're able to spare some dollars to keep it functioning as it should. There's a couple of ways to do it:

Become a patron, supporting the project with a small monthly amount.
