The container is available from the Docker registry and this is the simplest way to get it.
To run the container use this command:

```
$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -d \
              -v /your/storage/path/:/data \
              -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
              -e CREATE_TUN_DEVICE=true \
              -e OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PIA \
              -e OPENVPN_CONFIG=CA\ Toronto \
              -e OPENVPN_USERNAME=user \
              -e OPENVPN_PASSWORD=pass \
              -e WEBPROXY_ENABLED=false \
              -e LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/16 \
              --log-driver json-file \
              --log-opt max-size=10m \
              -p 9091:9091 \
              haugene/transmission-openvpn
```

You must set the environment variables `OPENVPN_PROVIDER`, `OPENVPN_USERNAME` and `OPENVPN_PASSWORD` to provide basic connection details.

The `OPENVPN_CONFIG` is an optional variable. If no config is given, a default config will be selected for the provider you have chosen.
Find available OpenVPN configurations by looking in the openvpn folder of the GitHub repository. The value that you should use here is the filename of your chosen openvpn configuration *without* the .ovpn file extension. For example:

```
-e "OPENVPN_CONFIG=ipvanish-AT-Vienna-vie-c02"
```

You can also provide a comma separated list of openvpn configuration filenames.
If you provide a list, a file will be randomly chosen in the list, this is useful for redundancy setups. For example:
```
-e "OPENVPN_CONFIG=ipvanish-AT-Vienna-vie-c02,ipvanish-FR-Paris-par-a01,ipvanish-DE-Frankfurt-fra-a01"
```
If you provide a list and the selected server goes down, after the value of ping-timeout the container will be restarted and a server will be randomly chosen, note that the faulty server can be chosen again, if this should occur, the container will be restarted again until a working server is selected.

To make sure this work in all cases, you should add ```--pull-filter ignore ping``` to your OPENVPN_OPTS variable.

As you can see, the container also expects a data volume to be mounted.
This is where Transmission will store your downloads, incomplete downloads and look for a watch directory for new .torrent files.

##### Alternative VPN configurations (PIA)
When using PIA as VPN Provider, several custom configurations could be used: 
```
-e "OPENVPN_CONFIG=nextgen/France"
```

The following folders can be used:

| Folder name | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| nextgen* | New configuration format, uses different domain names and supposedly has support for port forwarding in more locations |
| strong | Uses stronger encryption than the standard |
| ip | Does not use DNS names, but connects to IP addresses | 
| tcp | uses TCP instead of UDP |
| tcp-strong | Uses stronger encryption than standard and uses TCP instead of UDP |

\* NOTE: nextgen config currently not working, since PIA is still migrating servers.
