This script is responsible for doing initial setup and preparing what is needed for OpenVPN to run successfully.</p>"},{"location":"building-blocks/#starting_openvpn","title":"Starting OpenVPN","text":"<p>The main purpose of the start-up script is to figure out which OpenVPN config to use. OpenVPN itself can be started with a single argument, and that is the config file. We also add a few more to tell it to start Transmission when the VPN tunnel is started and to stop Transmission when OpenVPN is stopped. That's it.</p> <p>Apart from that, the script does some firewall config, VPN interface setup and possibly other things based on your settings. There are also some reserved script names that a user can mount/add to the container to include their own scripts as a part of the setup or teardown of the container.</p> <p>Anyways! You have probably seen the docker run and docker-compose configuration examples and you've put two and two together: This is where environment variables come in. Setting environment variables is a common way to pass configuration options to containers and it is the way we have chosen to do it here. So far, we've explained the need for <code>OPENVPN_PROVIDER</code> and <code>OPENVPN_CONFIG</code>. We use the combination of these two to find the right config. <code>OPENVPN_CONFIG</code> is not set as a mandatory option as each provider should have a default config that will be used if none is set.</p> <p>With the config file identified we're ready to start OpenVPN, the only thing missing are probably a username and password. There are some free providers out there, but they are the exceptions to the rule. We must inject the username/password into the config somehow. Again there are exceptions but the majority of configs from regular providers contain a line with <code>auth-user-pass</code> which will make OpenVPN prompt for username and password when you start a connection. That will obviously not work for us, so we need to modify that option. If it's followed by a path to a file, it will read the first line of that file as username and the second line as password.</p> <p>You provide your username and password as <code>OPENVPN_USERNAME</code> and <code>OPENVPN_PASSWORD</code>. These will be written into two lines in a file called <code>/config/openvpn-credentials.txt</code> on start-up by the start script. Having written your username/password to a file, we can successfully start OpenVPN.</p>"},{"location":"building-blocks/#starting_transmission","title":"Starting Transmission","text":"<p>We're using the <code>up</code> option from OpenVPN to start Transmission.</p> <p>--up cmd \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Run command cmd after successful TUN/TAP device open</p> <p>This means that Transmission will be started when OpenVPN has connected successfully and opened the tunnel device. We are having OpenVPN call the tunnelUp.sh script which in turn will call the start scripts for Transmission and  Privoxy.</p> <p>The up script will be called with a number of parameters from OpenVPN, and among them is the IP of the tunnel interface. This IP is the one we've been assigned by DHCP from the OpenVPN server we're connecting to. We use this value to override Transmission\u2019s bind address, so we'll only listen for traffic from peers on the VPN interface.</p> <p>The start-up script checks to see if one of the alternative web UIs should be used for Transmission. It also sets up the user that Transmission should be run as, based on the PUID and PGID passed by the user along with selecting preferred logging output and a few other tweaks.</p> <p>Before starting Transmission we also need to see if any settings should be overridden. One example of this is binding Transmission to the IP we've gotten from our VPN provider. Here we check if we find any environment variables that match a setting that we also see in settings.json. This is described in the config section. Setting a matching environment variable will then override the setting in Transmission.</p> <p>OpenVPN does not pass the environment variables it was started with to Transmission. To still be able to access them when starting Transmission, we're writing the ones we need to a file when starting OpenVPN. That way we can read them back and use them here. With the environment variables in place this script then overwrites the selected properties in settings.json and we're ready to start Transmission itself.</p> <p>After starting Transmission there is an optional step that some providers have; to get an open port and set it in Transmission. Opening a port in your local router does not work. I made that bold because it's a recurring theme. It's not intuitive until it is, I guess. Since all your traffic is going through the VPN, which is kind of the point, the port you have to open is not on your router. Your router's external IP address is the destination of those packets. It is on your VPN provider\u2019s end that it has to be opened. Some providers support this, others don't. We try to write scripts for those that do, and that script will be executed after starting Transmission if it exists for your provider.</p> <p>At this point, Transmission is running, and everything is great! But you might not be able to access it, and that's the topic of the networking section.</p>"},{"location":"config-options/","title":"Configuration options","text":""},{"location":"config-options/#required_environment_options","title":"Required environment options","text":"Variable Function Example <code>OPENVPN_PROVIDER</code> Sets the OpenVPN provider to use. <code>OPENVPN_PROVIDER=provider</code>.

The most common is that it happens with <code>curl</code> trying to download the latest .ovpn config bundle for those providers that have an update script, or that OpenVPN throws the error when trying to connect to the VPN server.</p> <p>The curl error looks something like <code>curl: (6) Could not resolve host: ...</code> and OpenVPN says <code>RESOLVE: Cannot resolve host address: ...</code>. Either way, the problem is that your container does not have a valid DNS setup. We have two recommended ways of addressing this.</p> <p>The first solution is to use the <code>dns</code> option offered by Docker. This is available in Docker run as well as Docker Compose. You can add <code>--dns 8.8.8.8 --dns 8.8.4.4</code> to use Google DNS servers. Or add the corresponding block in docker-compose.yml:</p> <pre><code>  dns:\n    - 8.8.8.8\n    - 8.8.4.4\n</code></pre> <p>You can of course use any DNS servers you want here. Google servers are popular. So is Cloudflare DNS.</p> <p>The second approach is to use some environment variables to override <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> in the container. Using the same DNS servers as in the previous approach you can set:</p> <pre><code>OVERRIDE_DNS_1=8.8.8.8\nOVERRIDE_DNS_2=8.8.4.4\n</code></pre> <p>This will be read by the startup script and it will override the contents of <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> accordingly. You can have one or more of these servers and they will be sorted alphabetically.</p> <p>What is the difference between these solutions?</p> <p>A good question as they both seem to override what DNS servers the container should use. However, they are not equal.</p> <p>The first solution uses the dns flags from Docker. This will mean that we instruct Docker to use these DNS servers for the container, but the resolv.conf file in the container will still point to the Docker DNS service. Docker might have many reasons for this but one of them is at least for service discovery. If you're running your container as a part of a larger docker-compose file or custom docker network and you want to be able to lookup the other containers based on their service names then you need to use the Docker DNS service. By using the <code>--dns</code> flags you should have both control of what DNS servers are used for external requests as well as container DNS lookup.</p> <p>The second solution is more direct. It rewrites the resolv.conf file so that it no longer refers to the Docker DNS service. The effect of this is that you lose Docker service discovery from the container (other containers in the same network can still resolve it) but you have cut out a middleman and potential point of error. I'm not sure why this sometimes is necessary but it has proven to fix the issue in some cases.</p> <p>A possible third option</p> <p>If you're facing the OpenVPN error (not curl) then your provider might have config files with IP addresses instead of DNS. That way your container won't need DNS to do a lookup for the server. Note that the trackers will still need DNS, so this will only solve the problem for you if it is your local network that in some way is blocking the DNS.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#container_loses_connection_after_some_time","title":"Container loses connection after some time","text":"<p>For some users, on some platforms, this is an issue.

So if the tunnel fails, OpenVPN will restart and re-connect. That works well on regular systems. The problem is that if the container has lost internet connection restarting OpenVPN will not fix anything. What you can do though is to set/override this option using <code>OPENVPN_OPTS=--inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60</code>. This will tell OpenVPN to exit when it cannot ping the server for 1 minute.</p> <p>When OpenVPN exits, the container will exit. And if you've then set <code>restart=always</code> or <code>restart=unless-stopped</code> in your Docker config then Docker will restart the container and that could/should restore connectivity. VPN providers sometimes push options to their clients after they connect. This is visible in the logs if they do. If they push ping-restart that can override your settings.

The benefit of choosing yourself is that you can choose a region that is closer to you and that might be better for speed.

That is great from a maintenance perspective, but it also means that we don't know the valid choices for the providers ahead of time. A tip for finding out is to set <code>OPENVPN_CONFIG=dummy</code> and start it. This will fail, but in the logs, it will print all the valid options.</p> <p>Pro tip: choose multiple servers. For example: <code>OPENVPN_CONFIG=france,sweden,austria,italy,belgium</code> This will ensure a location near you, but at the same time, it will allow some redundancy. Set Docker to restart the container automatically and you have a failover mechanism. The container chooses one of the configs at random when it starts and it will bounce from server to server until it finds one that works.</p>"},{"location":"run-container/#3_you_might_not_be_able_to_access_the_web_ui_on_the_first_try","title":"3.

These are called CIDR addresses and you can read up on them. The short story is that /24 will allow for any value in the last digit place while /16 will allow any value in the two last places. Be sure to only allow IPs that are in the private IP ranges. This option punches a hole in the VPN for the IPs that you specify. It is necessary to reach your Web UI but narrower ranges are better than wide ones.</p> <p>With that said. If you know that you're on a \"typical\" network with your router at 192.168.1.1, then <code>LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.1.0/24</code> is better than <code>LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/16</code>.

The proxy used is Privoxy and is highly configurable using the built-in web interface available on config.privoxy.org (available once your browser is correctly configured to use the localhost:8118 HTTP Proxy). This is useful if you are using a private tracker that needs to see you log in from the same IP address you are torrenting from. The default listening port is 8118. Note that only ports above 1024 can be specified as all ports below 1024 are privileged and would otherwise require root permissions to run. Remember to add a port binding for your selected (or default) port when starting the container.</p> Variable Function Example <code>WEBPROXY_ENABLED</code> Enables the web proxy <code>WEBPROXY_ENABLED=true</code> <code>WEBPROXY_PORT</code> Sets the listening port <code>WEBPROXY_PORT=8118</code> <p>The listening address is the one found bound to the eth0 interface.</p> <p><code>adr=$(ip -4  a show eth0| grep -oP \"(?&lt;=inet )([^/]+)\")</code></p>"}]}
